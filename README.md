# Hotel_Guest_Churn_Prediction_&_Cancellation_Prediction

### Motivation
My goal for this project includes the following
- To maximise my time at home during my country's lockdown (circuit breaker)
- Widen my knowledge on data engineering and wrangling with messy data
- Learn more about the XGBoost algorithm (WIP)
- Hone my Tensorflow and Pytorch coding skills and widen my deep learning knowledge

### Synopsis
With the ability to use data to find insights in almost everything, I found this dataset available on Kaggle and was very interested on what I could potentially do with this dataset. This dataset opened the door to finding insights about many things, including some guests' behaviours, types of guests who are most likely to cancel and etc.

You may find more information about my thought process about the work along the way and code in 'Hotel_Data_Analysis.ipynb' and the data from https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand
